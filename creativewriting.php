					<h2 style="color: grey">An uncle seeks to redeem himself, by stealing.</h2>
					<h3><a class="smallertitle">A family of four: a mother with curly brown hair and big, oval glasses; a father with combed, silver hair and a trimmed, silver mustache; a daughter, with green eyes and brown hair tied in a bun; a son, fresh out of college with curly black hair and black, thick framed glasses. They silently stare upon the screen of a computer monitor. The image on the screen is black: the computer is streaming live footage from a camera, but the camera is turned off.
						"He's not going to carry out with the plans, Jen," the father says. "He's probably parked in a parking lot, passed out, smelling ripe of cheap booze and cigarette smoke." Before Jennifer could respond, the video feed sparks to life. Uncle Ben appears. He's holding the camera pointed at his face and he's sitting in the driver's seat of a parked car. "Hey! You guys decided to watch the show! Yeah, I'm going through with the plans after all. I figured why the fuck not? Oh! I left the ear-piece at the house, so uh, it looks like we'll be talking on a one-way channel." The father curses under his breath. Jennifer releases a quiet moan. Her brother, Max, shakes his head slowly and their mother folds her arms in a one-person hug. The man in the video is noticeably drunk. "So here's the plan, family," Uncle Ben says into the camera. "I've got all my gear, I've got the forged painting to perform the swap, and I've got this baby." He pulls a side-arm into view. "What could go wrong?"

					<h2 style="color: white">A telemarketer recognizes a voice.</h2>
					<h3 class="smallertitle" style="color: grey">I looked down at my feet, I looked at the bright blue socks I was wearing, I looked up at Jim's face and failed to hold eye contact, I looked around his cube and the numerous coffee stains on the desk and the carpet, and finally, looked back at him. "I've got nothing to lose, man. I'll be polite and frank and if I'm lucky she won't be creeped-out. I'll simply ask her out for coffee. If I fail, I fail. So it goes."
						The next day, my heart was pounding. I did the research the previous night and found absolutely nothing. My stalker-powers were thwarted. And so, I dialed her number. It's just a phone call. I didn't talk to Jim first; I didn't need a pep-talk. The phone rang, I could feel my heartbeat through my ear as it pressed against the phone, the ring tone came, and then went, came, and went, came, went -
						"Hello? This is -"
						It was her voice.

				<h2 style="color: white">It begins with a toaster.</h2>
				<h3 class="smallertitle" style="color: grey">A jarring CLAP shakes old man Avery from his early-afternoon daydream. The noise came from the sound of the toaster's spring launching a crispy, golden-brown bagel into the air. It was a sound that he hated: he always loved the bagel the toaster produced, but he cursed under his breath every time the contraption ejected the food with a sound not entirely unlike that of a car crash. He is so startled that as he rises from his small, wooden table in the corner of the kitchen, he can't recall the daydream that was occupying his uneventful afternoon. He moves across the kitchen and reaches for the bagel but is interrupted by a knock at the door. He leaves the bagel in the toaster and moves toward the door. A man with a clever smile and combed, blonde hair is standing on the porch. The man has a small amount of perspiration on his tanned and handsomely wrinkled forehead, and he carries a coat upon his left shoulder. His sleeves are rolled up, and he says with a smile, "Hello, Mr. Avery. You've never met me, but I'm the God of All Things. I have a request for you." Avery blinks and shakes his head in confusion. "That's an odd introduction. Well, what's your request?" The man who claims to be God melts into a warm smile, "We'll talk about that, but let's step inside, it's unbearable out here."

				<h2 style="color: grey">A comedian does stand-up with Death.</h2>
				<h3><a class="smallertitle">This night felt a bit different for Dave. His jokes were landing, but he felt off. It didn't help that the green room smelled faintly of vomit. He coudn't wait for the intermission to be over, for the night to be over. Even prior to the intermission he knew something didn't feel right. Dave didn't get cold feet and neither did he get nervous; he quite simply wasn't feeling it, like an athlete stepping onto the pitch not wanting to win. He felt like it didn't matter; he felt like nothing mattered.
					Dave walked back on stage. The audience greeted him with hesitant applause. Better than usual, he thought.
					The lights were suddenly bright. And then, a pain in his right arm, a pain in his chest, the lights now blinding, the sounds of the audience gone. He fell to the ground, knocking over the microphone stand with a thunderous noise. When he came to he was staring at a black shoes. No ankles, but pants and a suit hovered above them. His head was throbbing and he was still on the stage and the audience was in their seats, motionless. Colorless. Silent. They were frozen in time. A gloved hand appeared before him. Except there was no wrist here either. "Get up, Dave. You're dead but not gone."
