					<h1 style="color: white;">Homefront is</h1>
					<h3 style="color: grey;">a 2D, story and turn-based game that was created utilizing
					primary and secondary sources involving the Vietnam War. While Stefan was the only person who developed
					the game, it was his 3 team members who developed the story, music, and art assets. The team considered using a 
					digital drawing pad for the art, but ended up taking high resolution images of pencil-drawn
					sketches, giving a unique aesthetic. The historical documents found gave a 
					surplus of anecdotal information from the American families that had sons or fathers die in the war,
					and so the objective with <i>Homefront</i> was to create a game that used real stories to
					give life to the story created for the game. The player controls a child who has been told by his mother that his
					father, a soldier in Vietnam, has died. The player controls the child and can
					walk around his home, speak to his mother, interact with items like a radio, a portrait of his father, and his father's guitar.
					In each interaction historical sources are used to give authenticity to the environment. As the player explorers the home
					the child has imagined fights with "monsters" that remind him of his father and the war that took him away.

					<h3 style="color: grey;">While Stefan's sketches did not go into the final game, he did help develop some of the concept
					art for the monsters the player fights in the game. Above is a newspaper monster, inspired by the idea that
					the child would lash out at the newspaper bearing news about Vietnam.

					<h3 style="color: white">Lessons Learned</h3>
					<h3 style="color: white"><ul>
						<li>Research yields inspiration.</li>
						<li>Details make a world of difference.</li>
						<li>Team brainstorming.</li>
					</ul></h3>
					
					<h3><a class="smallertitle">When Stefan studied abroad in London of 2014 he discoverd a love for research. He
					had already done research for other classes, but found something special in the experience of entering the
					British Library and combing through old documents written by people from a different place and time.
					Stefan would often get distracted while reading through the texts, thinking about how the contents would make for
					interesting elements in video games. When he began <i>Homefront</i> he realized that historical documents could be
					used across the game, and as the team did more and more research they became more and more inspired. While
					extensive historical research might not be relevant for all games, Stefan has plans to create games that borrow
					heavily from history, religion, myth, and literature.
					</a></h3>
					
					<h3 style="color: grey;"><i>Homefront</i>, (not bearing any inspiration from the action shooter of the
					same name), was inspired by games like <a href="http://www.gonehomegame.com/"><i>Gone Home</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound"><i>EarthBound</i></a> (<i>Mother</i> in Japan)
					 and <a href="http://www.krillbite.com/ats/"><i>Among the Sleep</i></a>. The team wanted battles with monsters and
					complex family relationships like those seen in <i>EarthBound</i>, to convey a sense of innocence and fear 
					 like that in <i>Among the Sleep</i>, and finally, to have an environment rich with detail and story like that
					 in <i>Gone Home</i>. In the games Stefan has played, he has found that it's the detail that makes the experience great. Detail
					 rewards the patient players, it can give a sense of scale and depth, and it can simply make things <i>feel</i> better.
					 Developing this game has taught Stefan that you can have detail, and that while not every player may see or appreciate the
					 detail put into the game, putting in the extra effort can make a big difference for how the game is perceived by many.</h3>
					
					<h3 style="color: white">
					 A finer detail not mentioned in the previous notes is that the game actually begins in a fantasy
					setting. The player doesn't control a child in a suburban American home: the child is a prince,
					his mother a benevolent fortune teller, and his father a legendary knight away at war with the
					goblin menace. As the player explorers more of the "castle" the fantastical details and imagery break
					down and reveal the truth underneath: they're just a family in a small home. The team wanted the deterioration
					of fantasy to reality to demonstrate the innocence the child lost as he became more and more exposed to the
					events surrounding the Vietnam War. This idea was born in a brainstorming session and grew into the team's proudest
					element of the game. The initial brainstorming sessions were very successful: the team clicked and
					connected over the project. Many of Stefan's prior projects were solo-ventures. If he learned anything from
					this experience, it's that teams can develop incredible things.
					</h3>

					<h3 style="color: grey;">Another monster the team was interested in was a television. The child 
					finds reminders of his father each time he sees news broadcasts about Vietnam.

			<h1 style="color: white">What's next for this game?</h1>
			
			<h3 style="color: grey;">Sadly, nothing. The code has been lost, the art has been lost, and the team is split across
			the country. That being said, it was something they'll all remember for quite some time. Who knows? Maybe they'll
			either make their own games that will be similar to this, or they'll meet again.</h3>
