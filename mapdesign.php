					I'm an explorer at heart. When I was younger I climbed trees, went on hikes, crawled through pipes and trespassed in construction zones.
					It comes to no surprise then that I love exploring in games. I can still remember the maps and environments of video games from my earliest
					childhood, whether it be from Banjo Kazooie, or the Viridian Forest in Pokemon Yellow. Even before I could develop maps I would draw them
					out for fun. I began making maps in Halo 3, and continued making maps in each subsequent Halo game to come. Below are two of my favorite
					and most recent maps, and at the bottom is a blurb from a map analyzation I conducted. Be sure to follow the link to read the full text.

					Degradation is a close-quarters map developed in Halo 5's forge mode. The process of
					making the map began with me searching the template map called Ravine (hence the waterfall
					and water elements) for a location that could contain the map I would create. I loved
					the waterfall and the small pond and the surrounding cliffs so I sketched out the buildings
					and walkways on paper to get an idea where to begin. From that point I jumped into the Forge
					mode and began placing walls, rocks, floors and more to make the map. The small cave was hand-made
					with placed rocks as well. I tested the map out with 
					friends to get feedback, and modified it once more for entry in a competition. (Spoiler: I 
					didn't win.) If you're interested in a video, take a look at my <a href="http://www.forgehub.com/maps/degradation.1862/">submission page.</a>

					Riptide was made in Halo 4's Forge mode. This map was heavily inspired by maps made
					by the devolopers of previous Halo maps and I wanted to capture some of the magic
					from those maps while still adding my own interpretation. I had yet to study level design in depth
					when I made this map, and its cramped and abstruse (or the lack-thereof) layout demonstrates my inexperience.
					It was still a learning lesson and I've taken a lot away from it.

				<h2 style="color: grey">
					On a website dedicated to Halo community maps, <a href="http://www.forgehub.com/">forgehub.com</a>, I decided to write a
					lengthy analysis of a classic map from Halo 3. I studied map and level design specific
					to first person shooting games and took special effort to note focal points, connections
					and paths, spawning, vehicular versus pedestrian movement, and more. Please follow the <a href="http://www.forgehub.com/threads/designing-for-big-team-map-survey-valhalla.151330/#post-1633620">link</a>
