				“Hey! You guys decided to watch the show! Yeah, I’m going through with the plans after all. I figured

				created many maps using Halo's "Forge", a tool for making battlegrounds to play with friends. He's been involved in the community and has engaged in
				map testing, map analyzations, and map creation. This written analyzation describes the level design of a map made by Halo's developers, Bungie Studios.
				Stefan utilizes industry terminology and concepts to pick apart the multiplayer map, and is working with community members to continue analyzing and
				creating content. Some of his community colleages have made maps that were recognized by Halo's developers and were made standard in online play. Stefan
				wants to get to the point where he too can create content that can be embraced by game developers and the community.</p>

				<p class="writingtitle"> Level Design in Multiplayer Video Games</p>
				<p class="writingtext">	An important question a designer must ask themselves is how they’d like to implement focal points on their map. One approach is to have a single,
				dominant focal point -- see Halo 3's Valhalla -- that will focus the fighting toward that area. The direct route a player will take toward controlling this central
				point is the most dangerous, as is shown by the heat map. To reward players who attempt to flank, the map has two lesser focal points, the pelican (8)
				and the turret (6). These points are essential in checking the power of the central focal point. If a BTB map has a dominant focal point, it needs to be checked.</p>
				<button id="designbutton" onclick="showHiddenText('2', this.id)" type="button" class="btn btn-default max" aria-label="Right Align">
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true">expand</span>
				</button>
				<p id="designtext" class="hiddentext">When the fighting makes its way from the center of the map toward the bases, the smaller focal points appear.
				For each base there is a position that is advantageous to attack from, and a position that is less so. Base 1 (using the numbers on the above image)
				has the slanted rock above and to the right of it. This rock is both a good position to be defensive in support of base 1, and offensive in opposition
				of base 1. The opposite side of base 1, where the trees are grouped, does not offer an advantageous defensive or offensive position. It should be no
				surprise then, that there is an elevated and slightly enclosed area just behind this location that is used for spawning. On the other end, base 2 has
				a side that features a snowy path leading to a waterfall. This path is ideal for attacking the base, and provides a good location to defend the base
				from attackers by the river. On the opposite end of base 2 is no area that is good for defense or offense, and it also features a spawning location
				similar to that of base 1. This structure around the bases ensures that each base has an area to attack said base, and an area that players can spawn
				into that isn’t a location the enemy is likely to hold.

				<p class="writingtitle"> A History Paper</p>
				<p class="writingtext">	To establish a conclusion today, 40 years following its outcome, about the Vietnam War requires
				a dizzying effort of fact-checking, double-fact- checking and source-scrounging. If peering into the
				historiography of Vietnam is itself a dizzying ordeal, is it no coincidence that the American perception of
				Vietnam is also perplexed? In order to demonstrate the confusion inherent in the historiography of
				Vietnam, a look into several documents and their approaches of presenting information is necessary,
				and in combination with a criticism and contextualization of them and the facts they present, it will
				become apparent that the documentation and the facts of the Vietnam War were often misleading,
				frequently counter-intuitive, and ultimately confusing for the American audience.</p>
				<button id="historybutton" onclick="showHiddenText('3', this.id)" type="button" class="btn btn-default max" aria-label="Right Align">
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true">expand</span>
				</button>
				<p id="historytext" class="hiddentext">Before the appropriate analysis, it is emphasized that the scope of this essay is clearly not such
				that it will survey a vast number of Vietnam documents in order to prove its point. Many who have
				researched and written on Vietnam have worked toward achieving this goal, and the purpose of this
				essay is to contribute to the larger discussion, even if it be with a small voice. The large voices, like that
				of Wesley Fishel, editor of Vietnam: Anatomy of a Conflict published in 1968, have come to a consensus
				that the data surrounding Vietnam is confusing and often contradictory. In the preface he discusses the
				media’s role in presenting information: “Embellishments have been mixed with rumors, half-truths,
				outright fabrications, dubious statistics, and a few substantiable facts to form fantastic mélanges
				accepted by the gullible – and there are many – as accurate representations of reality.” 1 Fishel goes on
				to criticize the lack of academic study: “The absence of substantial institutional commitments to
				research or instruction on Vietnam is paradoxical given the saturation of the American (and world) mass
				media with information and opinions about it.” 2 In George Katsiaficas’s collection of sources, Vietnam
				Documents: American and Vietnamese Views of the War, published several years later in 1992, he
				describes his take on the Vietnam historiography as well: “the documents collected here illustrate the
				differing perceptions and beliefs … In selecting the contents of each chapter, I have provided a balance
				so the reader can experience the conflicting points of view.” 3 And as John Rowe argues in the Vietnam
				War and American Culture published a year earlier in 1991, “the enormous volume of conflicting
				accounts of Vietnam has given special significance to the irreducible textuality of history”, this essay will
				offer its own criticisms and analyses to arrive at the same conclusion. 4 While there are many reasons for
				any circumstance in history, the pervasive controversy in America concerning the Vietnam War is likely
				to have had many sources, but when the historiography of the era is investigated, it will become clear
				that it has an important place in the conversation regarding this controversy’s persistence.

				<p class="descriptiontext">During a study abroad experience in London, Stefan had the opportunity to use the British Library, the second largest library in the world. As a student of
				computer science, Stefan had always been used to using digital records for research, but here in the UK he discovered a passion for something different.
				Looking through the British Library he found documents and books hundreds of years old, and was able to conduct research on the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666).
				Ever since then he's fallen in love with digging into books and conducting research, whether it be for papers on the Vietnam War, sampled here, or for philosophy, history, or art. </p>
