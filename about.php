			<h3 style="color: grey;">Stefan's current
			 goals are threefold. The first is to expand public schooling.
			 Raised by parents who worked tirelessly in education, Stefan
			 believes that the best way to change the world is by making it
			 smarter. IT can make that happen. Starting small with
			 goIT, Stefan hopes to launch into a larger career making apps or games
			 to help students learn. Stefan also wants to find ways to make
			 education cheaper and more accessible across the world. He wants
			 to move to Cuba in coming years to teach or develop infrastrure
			 for IT education, (and to better practice his Spanish) and hopes
			 to some day teach computer science in colleges and universities.</h3>
			 
			 <h3><a class="smallertitle">Stefan wants to develop video games
			 and interactive media. His passion for literature,
			 film, and social interaction leads him to believe that video games
			 are an emerging art form that is both accessible and distinct. Check
			 out the <a href="/index.php#gameDevelopment"/>game section on this website to learn more.</a></h3>
			 
			 <h3 style="color: grey;">Hoping to go back to school to study neuroscience
			 and to further his education in computer science, Stefan wants to delve into
			 the research and development of Artificial Intelligence. He took a class in AI in college
			 and implemented his own evolutionary algorithm, and ever since then he's
			 been thrilled at the advances in machine learning, whether it be in self-driving
			 cars or in image recognition, natural language processing, and more.</h3>
			
			<h3 style="color: white">Life Targets</h3>
			<h3 style="color: white"><ul>
				<li>Become member of the Blue Man Group</li>
				<li>Work Overseas</li>
				<li>Publish a Novel</li>
			</ul></h3>
			
			<h3 style="color: grey;">Okay, okay, Stefan knows that he isn't cut out
			for the Blue Man Group, but he's always had a passion for percussion.
			He played the drums in a band in college and wants to get back into making
			music. The same goes for ceramic arts. Stefan took two classes in ceramics
			and continues to take classes outside of school. He hopes that he'll keep making
			more pottery and that he'll keep getting better. He'd also like to get better at
			 taking photos and dreams someday of having a photo featured by National Geographic.</h3>
			 
			<h3><a class="smallertitle">Speaking of National Geographic, Stefan loves to travel. He had
			the unique opportunity to spend four months in London to study theatre, art, and history. While
			in Europe he also visited Italy, Turkey, Germany, Ireland, Scotland, and Denmark. He especially
			loved Copenhagen, and wants dearly to go back for work or for leisure.</a></h3>
			 
			<h3 style="color: grey;">Stefan has found that writing is fun, but he's mostly in it
			for the storytelling. He's also always had a passion for reading, too. Check out the
			writing section on this website to see books he recommends. Stefan has ideas for novels
			and has flexed his writing muscles in creative writing classes
			in college and continues to practice his writing when he can. He wants to publish a book someday, but
			he's got a lot more reading and learning to do first.
